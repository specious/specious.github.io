Extremely light, configurable, responsive intro page featuring a short info section and spinning circular menu. If you want it, it's yours.

My [website](https://git.io/specious) serves as the demo.

## Features

* Responsive layout and pure CSS animations (no dependence on JavaScript)
* Images and fonts are embedded directly in the HTML file (fast loading and portability)
* Configurable rotating circular menu
* Menu cover swings open when hovered and reveals a hidden element

## Develop

This project is written in [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/). The [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) script is instrumental in building the deliverable product.

First, install the dependencies by running:

```
yarn install
```

Build the `index.html` file by running:

```
yarn run build
```

You can start a watch process over the source files by running:

```
yarm run watch
```

When you save changes, `index.html` will be rebuilt.
